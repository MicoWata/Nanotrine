# Triangle from scratch in C, win32 and OpenGL

This project is about :
* creating a win32 window and opening an opengl version 3.3 context to draw a triangle in minimal, easy to read, plain C.
  
This project includes :
* triangle.exe, to run and test the program.
* run.cmd, a command file to compile and run the project in a simple console command.
* main.c, a single C file which :
  * requires no dependency at all,
  * opens a window and draws a triangle on it once per second,
  * listens for mouse and keyboard inputs.

Requirements :
* A Windows operating system.
* Any C compiler, but GCC is required to use the included run file.
