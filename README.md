# Hello triangle in C, using win32 and OpenGL

This project is about :
* creating a win32 window with an opengl 3.3 context to draw a triangle in minimal, easy to read, plain C.
* learning to design graphic engines at the bare operating system level.
* linking 
  
This project includes :
* triangle.exe, to run and test the program before reading.
* run.cmd, a command file to compile and run the project in a simple console command.
* main.c, a single C file which :
  * opens a window and draws a triangle in it once per second,
  * answers mouse and keyboard inputs,
  * requires no dependency outside the operating system.

Requirements :
* A Windows operating system, like Windows 10.
* Any C compiler, but GCC is required to use the included run file.
